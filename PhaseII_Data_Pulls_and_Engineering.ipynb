    "# Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook's purpose is to sift through all of the hospital chargemasters and metadata generated via the work already done in [this wonderful repo](https://github.com/vsoch/hospital-chargemaster) (from which I forked my repo). This is where the data engineering for Phase II of this project occurs. For more information on what Phase II is, please see [the README](README.md) for this project. Results from the explorations done in this notebook will be incorporated into a single cleaning script within the repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based upon the originating repo's own README, there's at least some data collection that still needs to be done for completeness (e.g. [data from hospitalpriceindex.com](https://search.hospitalpriceindex.com/hospital/Barnes-Jewish-Hospital/5359?page=1) has to be scraped but they're denying IP addresses that try to do so). However, that is beyond the current scope of this work."

    "\n",
    "*Assume everything in this cell is quoted directly from the originating repo README, albeit with some extra content removed for the purposes of streamlining. Anything in italics like this should be assumed to be editorial additions by me.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**From the original README:**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Get List of Hospital Pages\n",
    "We have compiled a list of hospitals and links in the [hospitals.tsv](hospitals.tsv) \n",
    "file, generated via the [0.get_hospitals.py](0.get_hospitals.py) script *which pulls these data from [a Quartz article](https://qz.com/1518545/price-lists-for-the-115-biggest-us-hospitals-new-transparency-law/) detailing ~115 hospital URLs from which the authors were able to find chargemasters in one form or another*. \n",
    "\n",
    "The file includes the following variables, separated by tabs:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **hospital_name** is the human friendly name\n",
    " - **hospital_url** is the human friendly URL, typically the page that includes a link to the data.\n",
    " - **hospital_id** is the unique identifier for the hospital, the hospital name, in lowercase, with spaces replaced with `-`\n",
    "   \n",
    "## Organize Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Each hospital has records kept in a subfolder in the [data](data) folder. Specifically,\n",
    "each subfolder is named according to the hospital name (made all lowercase, with spaces \n",
    "replaced with `-`). If a subfolder begins with an underscore, it means that I wasn't\n",
    "able to find the charge list on the hospital site (and maybe you can help?) \n",
    "Within that folder, you will find:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `scrape.py`: A script to scrape the data\n",
    " - `browser.py`: If we need to interact with a browser, we use selenium to do this.\n",
    " - `latest`: a folder with the last scraped (latest data files)\n",
    " - `YYYY-MM-DD` folders, where each folder includes:\n",
    "   - `records.json` the complete list of records scraped for a particular data\n",
    "   - `*.csv` or `*.xlsx` or `*.json`: the scraped data files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parsing\n",
    "This is likely one of the hardest steps. I wanted to see the extent to which I could\n",
    "create a simple parser that would generate a single TSV (tab separted value) file\n",
    "per hospital, with minimally an identifier for a charge, and a price in dollars. If\n",
    "provided, I would also include a description and code:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **charge_code**\n",
    " - **price**\n",
    " - **description**\n",
    " - **hospital_id**\n",
    " - **filename**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these parsers is also in the hospital subfolder, and named as \"parser.py.\" The parser would output a data-latest.tsv file at the top level of the folder, along with a dated (by year `data-<year>.tsv`). At some point\n",
    "I realized that there were different kinds of charges, including inpatient, outpatient, DRG (diagnostic related group) and others called\n",
    "\"standard\" or \"average.\" I then went back and added an additional column\n",
    "to the data:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **charge_type** can be one of standard, average, inpatient, outpatient, drg, or (if more detail is supplied) insured, uninsured, pharmacy, or supply. This is not a gold standard labeling but a best effort. If not specified, I labeled as standard, because this would be a good assumption."

And @vsoch was kind enough to try and compile them whenever appropriate in the various hospital/site-specific folders within `data` as `data-latest[-n].tsv` (`-n` indicates that, if the file gets above 100 MB, it's split into `data-latest-1.tsv`, `data-latest-2.tsv`, etc. to avoid going over the GitHub per-file size limit).\n",

    "    * `charge_code` and `description`: while from a data perspective these would likely be better handled in memory by making anything categorical that has so few unique values that the count of them is less than 50% of the count of all rows, it doesn't make sense to make these fields categoricals, as that implies they are drawing from a common data reference. That's simply not the case.\n",
    "        * Given that two different hospitals can have the charge code `1001` refer to two totally different procedures/consumables, there's no reason to add confusion by treating these in the dataset like they have the same meaning. \n",
    "        * The same logic goes for the description field (although that one has me scratching my head a bit, as I'd expect it to be a bit more free text in nature and thus not likely to have repeated values)\n",
    "    * `price`: this should be a continuous variable, not a categorical one!\n",
    "2. `hospital_id`, `filename`, and `charge_type`: these are classic examples of categorical variables and we should convert them.\n",
    "    * That being said, it's pretty clear from a very brief look at the unique values in the `hospital_id` field that something is fishy here and that likely some of the parsers have failed to work properly. So it looks like we'll need to parse each column separately and make corrections before proceeding further."
