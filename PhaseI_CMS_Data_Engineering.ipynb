    "# Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to pull down Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) data on hospital-level variables (e.g. the amount of times patients have serious falls in a given reporting period). This notebook focuses purely on the data wrangling and exploration steps of the Phase I analysis (please see the project's [README](README.md) for info on the Phases of this project). A separate notebook handles the more advanced modeling work for both Phases I and II. "

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "CMS collects are sorts of information on US hospitals as part of its role as a federally-managed insurance organization. I was inspired to think about modeling hospital outcomes by the news in early 2019 that CMS had mandated that all US hospital chargemaster data must be published online in machine-readable format on hospital websites. These tables provide the pre-insurance-negotiation prices for all procedures and consumables in a gvien hospital.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon digging a bit into the chargemasters data I could find (and forking [a very helpful repo](https://github.com/vsoch/hospital-chargemaster) that had done a lot of the heavy lifting parsing many hospitals' chargemaster data), I determined that the cleaning process for those data (including discerning what procedures and consumables were equivalent items, due to the shorthand used to describe them in many instances) would be a bigger task, so  I split the work into two phases as described in the README.\n",
