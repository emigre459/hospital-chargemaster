    "# Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook largely serves to allow me to sift through all of the chargemasters and metadata generated via the work already done in [this wonderful repo](https://github.com/vsoch/hospital-chargemaster) (from which I forked my repo). \n",
    "\n",
    "Based upon the originating repo's own README, there's at least some data collection that still needs to be done (e.g. [data from hospitalpriceindex.com](https://search.hospitalpriceindex.com/hospital/Barnes-Jewish-Hospital/5359?page=1) has to be scraped but they're denying IP addresses that try to do so). However, if any of that gets done in here, it won't be until after I've sifted through the current material to make sure I have a handle on what data are already available. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's fairly plausible that I'll then attempt to combine it all into a single sqlite or MongoDB database that can subsequently be analyzed. But I'm getting ahead of myself - first to figure out what we have to work with!"

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "*Assume everything in this cell is quoted directly from the originating repo README, albeit with some extra content removed for the purposes of streamlining. Anything in italics like this should be assumed to be editorial additions by me.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**From the original README:**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Get List of Hospital Pages\n",
    "We have compiled a list of hospitals and links in the [hospitals.tsv](hospitals.tsv) \n",
    "file, generated via the [0.get_hospitals.py](0.get_hospitals.py) script *which pulls these data from [a Quartz article](https://qz.com/1518545/price-lists-for-the-115-biggest-us-hospitals-new-transparency-law/) detailing ~115 hospital URLs from which the authors were able to find chargemasters in one form or another*. \n",
    "\n",
    "The file includes the following variables, separated by tabs:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **hospital_name** is the human friendly name\n",
    " - **hospital_url** is the human friendly URL, typically the page that includes a link to the data.\n",
    " - **hospital_id** is the unique identifier for the hospital, the hospital name, in lowercase, with spaces replaced with `-`\n",
    "   \n",
    "## Organize Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Each hospital has records kept in a subfolder in the [data](data) folder. Specifically,\n",
    "each subfolder is named according to the hospital name (made all lowercase, with spaces \n",
    "replaced with `-`). If a subfolder begins with an underscore, it means that I wasn't\n",
    "able to find the charge list on the hospital site (and maybe you can help?) \n",
    "Within that folder, you will find:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `scrape.py`: A script to scrape the data\n",
    " - `browser.py`: If we need to interact with a browser, we use selenium to do this.\n",
    " - `latest`: a folder with the last scraped (latest data files)\n",
    " - `YYYY-MM-DD` folders, where each folder includes:\n",
    "   - `records.json` the complete list of records scraped for a particular data\n",
    "   - `*.csv` or `*.xlsx` or `*.json`: the scraped data files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parsing\n",
    "This is likely one of the hardest steps. I wanted to see the extent to which I could\n",
    "create a simple parser that would generate a single TSV (tab separted value) file\n",
    "per hospital, with minimally an identifier for a charge, and a price in dollars. If\n",
    "provided, I would also include a description and code:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **charge_code**\n",
    " - **price**\n",
    " - **description**\n",
    " - **hospital_id**\n",
    " - **filename**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these parsers is also in the hospital subfolder, and named as \"parser.py.\" The parser would output a data-latest.tsv file at the top level of the folder, along with a dated (by year `data-<year>.tsv`). At some point\n",
    "I realized that there were different kinds of charges, including inpatient, outpatient, DRG (diagnostic related group) and others called\n",
    "\"standard\" or \"average.\" I then went back and added an additional column\n",
    "to the data:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **charge_type** can be one of standard, average, inpatient, outpatient, drg, or (if more detail is supplied) insured, uninsured, pharmacy, or supply. This is not a gold standard labeling but a best effort. If not specified, I labeled as standard, because this would be a good assumption."

    "# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",

    "OK, I think I have a handle on this, let's take a look at the data, starting with the hospital metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may be a bit confusing for anyone following along at home, but note that I had already started my own effort to download a bunch of these chargemasters in a far more manual approach than what @vsoch did with `BeautifulSoup` and all. As a result, I may be comparing her dataset at times in this notebook to the one I was developing. Mine was never going to have automated updates like hers however, hence why I'm deferring to her repo and data over my own (while mine may be a bit more comprehensive in terms of number of hospitals, I'd rather the data be up to date as much as possible). \n",
    "\n",
    "That said, as of this writing, I have approximately 600+ unique hospitals included in my chargemaster index, so I'm going to keep an eye out during my EDA to see if my more manual approach may still be useful."
