Footnote Crosswalk,https://data.medicare.gov/resource/sbph-xiia.json,List of footnotes referenced in many datasets and their summaries
Hospital General Information,https://data.medicare.gov/resource/rbry-mqwu.json,"A list of all hospitals that have been registered with Medicare. The list includes addresses, phone numbers, hospital type, and overall hospital rating."
Complications and Deaths - Hospital,https://data.medicare.gov/resource/ukfj-tt6v.json,"Complications and deaths data provided by the hospitals themselves. These data include the hip/knee complication measure, the CMS Patient Safety Indicators, and 30-day death rates."
Healthcare Associated Infections - Hospital,https://data.medicare.gov/resource/ppaw-hhm5.json,"Hospital-provided data. These measures are developed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and collected through the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). They provide information on infections that occur while the patient is in the hospital. These infections can be related to devices, such as central lines and urinary catheters, or spread from patient to patient after contact with an infected person or surface. Many healthcare associated infections can be prevented when the hospitals use CDC-recommended infection control steps."
Unplanned Hospital Visits - Hospital,https://data.medicare.gov/resource/r32h-32z5.json,"These are hospital-reported data for the hospital return days (or excess days in acute care [EDAC]) measures, the unplanned readmissions measures, and the rate of unplanned hospital visits after an outpatient colonoscopy. Effectively, it is concerned with unexpected readmissions for various procedures/treatments, something that normally indicates a complication (e.g. follow-on infection, ineffective treatment regimen, etc.)"
Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program,https://data.medicare.gov/resource/kac9-a9fp.json,"Measures of frequency of patient readmissions for the same illness/issue for which they were originally treated. Excess readmissions are measured by a ratio, calculated by dividing a hospital’s number of “predicted” 30-day readmissions for heart attack (AMI), heart failure (HF), pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hip/knee replacement (THA/TKA), and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) by the number that would be “expected,” based on an average hospital with similar patients."
Medicare Spending Per Beneficiary – Hospital Additional Decimal Places,https://data.medicare.gov/resource/8ckj-r4j6.json,"The Medicare Spending Per Beneficiary (MSPB) Measure shows whether Medicare spends more, less, or about the same for an episode of care at a specific hospital compared to all hospitals nationally. An MSPB episode includes Medicare Part A and Part B payments for services provided by hospitals and other healthcare providers the 3 days prior to, during, and 30 days following a patient’s inpatient stay. This measure evaluates hospitals’ costs compared to the costs of the national median hospital. This measure takes into account important factors like patient age and health status (risk adjustment) and geographic payment differences (payment-standardization). The data displayed here are identical to the data displayed in the “Medicare Spending per Beneficiary” file, except that this file displays hospitals’ measure values out to six decimal places instead of two decimal places."
Outpatient Imaging Efficiency - Hospital,https://data.medicare.gov/resource/72af-b2t9.json,"Hospital-provided data about the use of medical imaging in their facilities for outpatients. Examples of medical imaging tests include CT scans, MRIs, and mammograms."
Patient survey (HCAHPS) - Hospital,https://data.medicare.gov/resource/rmgi-5fhi.json,"A list of hospital ratings for the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS). HCAHPS is a national, standardized survey of hospital patients about their experiences during a recent inpatient hospital stay."
Structural Measures - Hospital,https://data.medicare.gov/resource/w5ci-7egs.json,"A list of hospitals and the structural measures they report. A structural measure reflects the environment in which hospitals care for patients, for example, whether or not a hospital participates in a Cardiac Surgery Registry or uses a safe surgery checklist."
